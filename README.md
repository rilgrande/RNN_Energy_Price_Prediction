# RNN_Energy_Price_Prediction

My goal for this project was to practice building a simple neural network model using the best available data on global energy prices, and take a look into how this model performed. I found an interesting implementation of this type of exercise on Kaggle, in which the model aimed to predict future crude oil prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. This model used the Keras free open source Python library, which is powerful and easy-to-use for developing and evaluating deep learning models. The library also has excellent documentation online and is relatively simple to work with. I originally intended to build a model using a normal RNN, but after some more research I found that the best model to model energy prices with these types of historical price datasets was an LSTM. LSTMs typically retain a longer-term context which helps to overcome the long-term dependency problem faced by other models.
